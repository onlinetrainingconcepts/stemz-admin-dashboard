					<p>&nbsp;CHAPTER 1. Loomings.</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						Call me Ishmael. Some years ago&mdash;never mind how long
						precisely&mdash;having little or no money in my purse, and nothing
						particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a
						little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of
						driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I
						find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp,
						drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily
						pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every
						funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper
						hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me
						from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically
						knocking people&rsquo;s hats off&mdash;then, I account it high time
						to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my secondarystitute for
						pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself
						upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing
						surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their
						degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings
						towards the ocean with me.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by
						wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs&mdash;commerce surrounds it
						with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its
						extreme downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by
						waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of
						sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from
						Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall,
						northward. What do you see?&mdash;Posted like silent sentinels all
						around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed
						in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon
						the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China;
						some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better
						seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in
						lath and plaster&mdash;tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched
						to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they
						here?
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and
						seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but
						the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of
						yonder warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh
						the water as they possibly can without falling in. And there they
						stand&mdash;miles of them&mdash;leagues. Inlanders all, they come
						from lanes and alleys, streets and avenues&mdash;north, east, south,
						and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue
						of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them
						thither?
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes.
						Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down
						in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is
						magic in it. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his
						deepest reveries&mdash;stand that man on his legs, set his feet
						a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be
						in all that region. Should you ever be athirst in the great American
						desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied
						with a metaphysical professor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation
						and water are wedded for ever.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest,
						shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all
						the valley of the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There
						stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a
						crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep
						his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep
						into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping
						spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue. But though the
						picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its
						sighs like leaves upon this shepherd&rsquo;s head, yet all were
						vain, unless the shepherd&rsquo;s eye were fixed upon the magic
						stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on
						scores of miles you wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies&mdash;what is
						the one charm wanting?&mdash;Water&mdash;there is not a drop of
						water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel
						your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee,
						upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether
						to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a
						pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust
						healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other
						crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did
						you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told that
						you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the old
						Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate
						deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without
						meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus,
						who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in
						the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that same image,
						we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the
						ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I
						begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of
						my lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as
						a passenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse,
						and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides,
						passengers get sea-sick&mdash;grow quarrelsome&mdash;don&rsquo;t
						sleep of nights&mdash;do not enjoy themselves much, as a general
						thing;&mdash;no, I never go as a passenger; nor, though I am
						something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a Commodore, or a
						Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction of such
						offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all
						honorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind
						whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself,
						without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what
						not. And as for going as cook,&mdash;though I confess there is
						considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer on
						ship-board&mdash;yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling
						fowls;&mdash;though once broiled, judiciously buttered, and
						judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who will speak
						more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than
						I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians
						upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the mummies
						of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the
						mast, plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal
						mast-head. True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump
						from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first,
						this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one&rsquo;s
						sense of honor, particularly if you come of an old established
						family in the land, the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or
						Hardicanutes. And more than all, if just previous to putting your
						hand into the tar-pot, you have been lording it as a country
						schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in awe of you. The
						transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a schoolmaster to a
						sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to
						enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off in time.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a
						broom and sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to,
						weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think
						the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I
						promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular
						instance? Who ain&rsquo;t a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however
						the old sea-captains may order me about&mdash;however they may thump
						and punch me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is
						all right; that everybody else is one way or other served in much
						the same way&mdash;either in a physical or metaphysical point of
						view, that is; and so the universal thump is passed round, and all
						hands should rub each other&rsquo;s shoulder-blades, and be content.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of
						paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single
						penny that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves
						must pay. And there is all the difference in the world between
						paying and being paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most
						uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon
						us. But being paid,&mdash;what will compare with it? The urbane
						activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous,
						considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all
						earthly ills, and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven.
						Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome
						exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world,
						head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is,
						if you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part
						the Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand
						from the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first;
						but not so. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their
						leaders in many other things, at the same time that the leaders
						little suspect it. But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly
						smelt the sea as a merchant sailor, I should now take it into my
						head to go on a whaling voyage; this the invisible police officer of
						the Fates, who has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly
						dogs me, and influences me in some unaccountable way&mdash;he can
						better answer than any one else. And, doubtless, my going on this
						whaling voyage, formed part of the grand programme of Providence
						that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in as a sort of brief
						interlude and solo between more extensive performances. I take it
						that this part of the bill must have run something like this:
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United
						States. &ldquo;WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. &ldquo;BLOODY BATTLE
						IN AFFGHANISTAN.&rdquo;
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers,
						the Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage,
						when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies,
						and short and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in
						farces&mdash;though I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now
						that I recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little into
						the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under
						various disguises, induced me to set about performing the part I
						did, besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice
						resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great
						whale himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all
						my curiosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his
						island bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these,
						with all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and
						sounds, helped to sway me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such
						things would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am
						tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail
						forbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is
						good, I am quick to perceive a horror, and could still be social
						with it&mdash;would they let me&mdash;since it is but well to be on
						friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the
						great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild
						conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated
						into my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most
						of them all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>CHAPTER 2. The Carpet-Bag.</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my
						arm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good
						city of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a
						Saturday night in December. Much was I disappointed upon learning
						that the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no
						way of reaching that place would offer, till the following Monday.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop
						at this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may
						as well be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my
						mind was made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because
						there was a fine, boisterous something about everything connected
						with that famous old island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides
						though New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolising the
						business of whaling, and though in this matter poor old Nantucket is
						now much behind her, yet Nantucket was her great original&mdash;the
						Tyre of this Carthage;&mdash;the place where the first dead American
						whale was stranded. Where else but from Nantucket did those
						aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes to give
						chase to the Leviathan? And where but from Nantucket, too, did that
						first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported
						cobblestones&mdash;so goes the story&mdash;to throw at the whales,
						in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon
						from the bowsprit?
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before
						me in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it
						became a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep
						meanwhile. It was a very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and
						dismal night, bitingly cold and cheerless. I knew no one in the
						place. With anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket, and only
						brought up a few pieces of silver,&mdash;So, wherever you go,
						Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of a dreary
						street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the north
						with the darkness towards the south&mdash;wherever in your wisdom
						you may conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to
						inquire the price, and don&rsquo;t be too particular.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of
						&ldquo;The Crossed Harpoons&rdquo;&mdash;but it looked too expensive
						and jolly there. Further on, from the bright red windows of the
						&ldquo;Sword-Fish Inn,&rdquo; there came such fervent rays, that it
						seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house,
						for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a
						hard, asphaltic pavement,&mdash;rather weary for me, when I struck
						my foot against the flinty projections, because from hard,
						remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable
						plight. Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one moment
						to watch the broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of the
						tinkling glasses within. But go on, Ishmael, said I at last;
						don&rsquo;t you hear? get away from before the door; your patched
						boots are stopping the way. So on I went. I now by instinct followed
						the streets that took me waterward, for there, doubtless, were the
						cheapest, if not the cheeriest inns.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						Such dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either
						hand, and here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a
						tomb. At this hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that
						quarter of the town proved all but deserted. But presently I came to
						a smoky light proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of
						which stood invitingly open. It had a careless look, as if it were
						meant for the uses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I
						did was to stumble over an ash-box in the porch. Ha! thought I, ha,
						as the flying particles almost choked me, are these ashes from that
						destroyed city, Gomorrah? But &ldquo;The Crossed Harpoons,&rdquo;
						and &ldquo;The Sword-Fish?&rdquo;&mdash;this, then must needs be the
						sign of &ldquo;The Trap.&rdquo; However, I picked myself up and
						hearing a loud voice within, pushed on and opened a second, interior
						door.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred
						black faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black
						Angel of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church;
						and the preacher&rsquo;s text was about the blackness of darkness,
						and the weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael,
						muttered I, backing out, Wretched entertainment at the sign of
						&lsquo;The Trap!&rsquo;
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the
						docks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw
						a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly
						representing a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words
						underneath&mdash;&ldquo;The Spouter Inn:&mdash;Peter Coffin.&rdquo;
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						Coffin?&mdash;Spouter?&mdash;Rather ominous in that particular
						connexion, thought I. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they
						say, and I suppose this Peter here is an emigrant from there. As the
						light looked so dim, and the place, for the time, looked quiet
						enough, and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if
						it might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt
						district, and as the swinging sign had a poverty-stricken sort of
						creak to it, I thought that here was the very spot for cheap
						lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						It was a queer sort of place&mdash;a gable-ended old house, one side
						palsied as it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp
						bleak corner, where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse
						howling than ever it did about poor Paul&rsquo;s tossed craft.
						Euroclydon, nevertheless, is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one
						in-doors, with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed.
						&ldquo;In judging of that tempestuous wind called Euroclydon,&rdquo;
						says an old writer&mdash;of whose works I possess the only copy
						extant&mdash;&ldquo;it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou
						lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the
						outside, or whether thou observest it from that sashless window,
						where the frost is on both sides, and of which the wight Death is
						the only glazier.&rdquo; True enough, thought I, as this passage
						occurred to my mind&mdash;old black-letter, thou reasonest well.
						Yes, these eyes are windows, and this body of mine is the house.
						What a pity they didn&rsquo;t stop up the chinks and the crannies
						though, and thrust in a little lint here and there. But it&rsquo;s
						too late to make any improvements now. The universe is finished; the
						copestone is on, and the chips were carted off a million years ago.
						Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth against the curbstone for
						his pillow, and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings, he
						might plug up both ears with rags, and put a corn-cob into his
						mouth, and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon.
						Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his red silken wrapper&mdash;(he had
						a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What a fine frosty night; how
						Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them talk of their
						oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the
						privilege of making my own summer with my own coals.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						But what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding them
						up to the grand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in
						Sumatra than here? Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise
						along the line of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery
						pit itself, in order to keep out this frost?
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before
						the door of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg
						should be moored to one of the Moluccas. Yet Dives himself, he too
						lives like a Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a
						president of a temperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of
						orphans.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						But no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and
						there is plenty of that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our
						frosted feet, and see what sort of a place this
						&ldquo;Spouter&rdquo; may be.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>CHAPTER 3. The Spouter-Inn.</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide,
						low, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of
						the bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very
						large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced,
						that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only
						by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it, and
						careful inquiry of the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at
						an understanding of its purpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades
						and shadows, that at first you almost thought some ambitious young
						artist, in the time of the New England hags, had endeavored to
						delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint of much and earnest
						contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and especially by
						throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry, you
						at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however wild,
						might not be altogether unwarranted.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber,
						portentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre of the
						picture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a
						nameless yeast. A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to
						drive a nervous man distracted. Yet was there a sort of indefinite,
						half-attained, unimaginable secondarylimity about it that fairly
						froze you to it, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself
						to find out what that marvellous painting meant. Ever and anon a
						bright, but, alas, deceptive idea would dart you
						through.&mdash;It&rsquo;s the Black Sea in a midnight
						gale.&mdash;It&rsquo;s the unnatural combat of the four primal
						elements.&mdash;It&rsquo;s a blasted heath.&mdash;It&rsquo;s a
						Hyperborean winter scene.&mdash;It&rsquo;s the breaking-up of the
						icebound stream of Time. But at last all these fancies yielded to
						that one portentous something in the picture&rsquo;s midst. That
						once found out, and all the rest were plain. But stop; does it not
						bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish? even the great
						leviathan himself?
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						In fact, the artist&rsquo;s design seemed this: a final theory of my
						own, partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons
						with whom I conversed upon the secondaryject. The picture represents
						a Cape-Horner in a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship
						weltering there with its three dismantled masts alone visible; and
						an exasperated whale, purposing to spring clean over the craft, is
						in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast-heads.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish
						array of monstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with
						glittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with
						knots of human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle
						sweeping round like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a
						long-armed mower. You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what
						monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a
						death-harvesting with such a hacking, horrifying implement. Mixed
						with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and
						deformed. Some were storied weapons. With this once long lance, now
						wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales
						between a sunrise and a sunset. And that harpoon&mdash;so like a
						corkscrew now&mdash;was flung in Javan seas, and run away with by a
						whale, years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco. The original
						iron entered nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle sojourning
						in the body of a man, travelled full forty feet, and at last was
						found imbedded in the hump.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						Crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched
						way&mdash;cut through what in old times must have been a great
						central chimney with fireplaces all round&mdash;you enter the public
						room. A still duskier place is this, with such low ponderous beams
						above, and such old wrinkled planks beneath, that you would almost
						fancy you trod some old craft&rsquo;s cockpits, especially of such a
						howling night, when this corner-anchored old ark rocked so
						furiously. On one side stood a long, low, shelf-like table covered
						with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities gathered from
						this wide world&rsquo;s remotest nooks. Projecting from the further
						angle of the room stands a dark-looking den&mdash;the bar&mdash;a
						rude attempt at a right whale&rsquo;s head. Be that how it may,
						there stands the vast arched bone of the whale&rsquo;s jaw, so wide,
						a coach might almost drive beneath it. Within are shabby shelves,
						ranged round with old decanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws
						of swift destruction, like another cursed Jonah (by which name
						indeed they called him), bustles a little withered old man, who, for
						their money, dearly sells the sailors deliriums and death.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though
						true cylinders without&mdash;within, the villanous green goggling
						glasses deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel
						meridians rudely pecked into the glass, surround these
						footpads&rsquo; goblets. Fill to this mark, and your charge is but a
						penny; to this a penny more; and so on to the full glass&mdash;the
						Cape Horn measure, which you may gulp down for a shilling.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered
						about a table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of
						skrimshander. I sought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be
						accommodated with a room, received for answer that his house was
						full&mdash;not a bed unoccupied. &ldquo;But avast,&rdquo; he added,
						tapping his forehead, &ldquo;you haint no objections to sharing a
						harpooneer&rsquo;s blanket, have ye? I s&rsquo;pose you are
						goin&rsquo; a-whalin&rsquo;, so you&rsquo;d better get used to that
						sort of thing.&rdquo;
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I
						should ever do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be,
						and that if he (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and
						the harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than
						wander further about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would
						put up with the half of any decent man&rsquo;s blanket.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;I thought so. All right; take a seat. Supper?&mdash;you want
						supper? Supper&rsquo;ll be ready directly.&rdquo;
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on
						the Battery. At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning
						it with his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at
						the space between his legs. He was trying his hand at a ship under
						full sail, but he didn&rsquo;t make much headway, I thought.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an
						adjoining room. It was cold as Iceland&mdash;no fire at
						all&mdash;the landlord said he couldn&rsquo;t afford it. Nothing but
						two dismal tallow candles, each in a winding sheet. We were fain to
						button up our monkey jackets, and hold to our lips cups of scalding
						tea with our half frozen fingers. But the fare was of the most
						secondarystantial kind&mdash;not only meat and potatoes, but
						dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow in a
						green box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most
						direful manner.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have
						the nightmare to a dead sartainty.&rdquo;
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;Landlord,&rdquo; I whispered, &ldquo;that aint the harpooneer
						is it?&rdquo;
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny,
						&ldquo;the harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap. He never eats
						dumplings, he don&rsquo;t&mdash;he eats nothing but steaks, and he
						likes &rsquo;em rare.&rdquo;
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;The devil he does,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;Where is that
						harpooneer? Is he here?&rdquo;
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be here afore long,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						I could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this
						&ldquo;dark complexioned&rdquo; harpooneer. At any rate, I made up
						my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together, he
						must undress and get into bed before I did.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						Supper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing
						not what else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the
						evening as a looker on.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						Presently a rioting noise was heard without. Starting up, the
						landlord cried, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the Grampus&rsquo;s crew. I seed
						her reported in the offing this morning; a three years&rsquo;
						voyage, and a full ship. Hurrah, boys; now we&rsquo;ll have the
						latest news from the Feegees.&rdquo;
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung
						open, and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough. Enveloped in
						their shaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen
						comforters, all bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with
						icicles, they seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador. They had
						just landed from their boat, and this was the first house they
						entered. No wonder, then, that they made a straight wake for the
						whale&rsquo;s mouth&mdash;the bar&mdash;when the wrinkled little old
						Jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out brimmers all round.
						One complained of a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah mixed him
						a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a
						sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of
						how long standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or
						on the weather side of an ice-island.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						The liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even
						with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began
						capering about most obstreperously.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and
						though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates
						by his own sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making
						as much noise as the rest. This man interested me at once; and since
						the sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate
						(though but a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is
						concerned), I will here venture upon a little description of him. He
						stood full six feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest
						like a coffer-dam. I have seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face
						was deeply brown and burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the
						contrast; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some
						reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy. His voice at
						once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine stature,
						I thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the
						Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When the revelry of his companions
						had mounted to its height, this man slipped away unobserved, and I
						saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea. In a few
						minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and being, it
						seems, for some reason a huge favourite with them, they raised a cry
						of &ldquo;Bulkington! Bulkington! where&rsquo;s Bulkington?&rdquo;
						and darted out of the house in pursuit of him.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						It was now about nine o&rsquo;clock, and the room seeming almost
						supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate
						myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to
						the entrance of the seamen.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						No man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal
						rather not sleep with your own brother. I don&rsquo;t know how it
						is, but people like to be private when they are sleeping. And when
						it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in
						a strange town, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections
						indefinitely multiply. Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a
						sailor should sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for
						sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do
						ashore. To be sure they all sleep together in one apartment, but you
						have your own hammock, and cover yourself with your own blanket, and
						sleep in your own skin.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the
						thought of sleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a
						harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be
						of the tidiest, certainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all
						over. Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought
						to be home and going bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon
						me at midnight&mdash;how could I tell from what vile hole he had
						been coming?
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;Landlord! I&rsquo;ve changed my mind about that
						harpooneer.&mdash;I shan&rsquo;t sleep with him. I&rsquo;ll try the
						bench here.&rdquo;
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;Just as you please; I&rsquo;m sorry I can&rsquo;t spare ye a
						tablecloth for a mattress, and it&rsquo;s a plaguy rough board
						here&rdquo;&mdash;feeling of the knots and notches. &ldquo;But wait
						a bit, Skrimshander; I&rsquo;ve got a carpenter&rsquo;s plane there
						in the bar&mdash;wait, I say, and I&rsquo;ll make ye snug
						enough.&rdquo; So saying he procured the plane; and with his old
						silk handkerchief first dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing
						away at my bed, the while grinning like an ape. The shavings flew
						right and left; till at last the plane-iron came bump against an
						indestructible knot. The landlord was near spraining his wrist, and
						I told him for heaven&rsquo;s sake to quit&mdash;the bed was soft
						enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing in the
						world could make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the
						shavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove
						in the middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me
						in a brown study.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot
						too short; but that could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot
						too narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches
						higher than the planed one&mdash;so there was no yoking them. I then
						placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against
						the wall, leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle
						down in. But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air
						over me from under the sill of the window, that this plan would
						never do at all, especially as another current from the rickety door
						met the one from the window, and both together formed a series of
						small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had
						thought to spend the night.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn&rsquo;t
						I steal a march on him&mdash;bolt his door inside, and jump into his
						bed, not to be wakened by the most violent knockings? It seemed no
						bad idea; but upon second thoughts I dismissed it. For who could
						tell but what the next morning, so soon as I popped out of the room,
						the harpooneer might be standing in the entry, all ready to knock me
						down!
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of
						spending a sufferable night unless in some other person&rsquo;s bed,
						I began to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable
						prejudices against this unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, I&rsquo;ll
						wait awhile; he must be dropping in before long. I&rsquo;ll have a
						good look at him then, and perhaps we may become jolly good
						bedfellows after all&mdash;there&rsquo;s no telling.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and
						threes, and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;Landlord!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what sort of a chap is
						he&mdash;does he always keep such late hours?&rdquo; It was now hard
						upon twelve o&rsquo;clock.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be
						mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension.
						&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;generally he&rsquo;s an early
						bird&mdash;airley to bed and airley to rise&mdash;yes, he&rsquo;s
						the bird what catches the worm. But to-night he went out a peddling,
						you see, and I don&rsquo;t see what on airth keeps him so late,
						unless, may be, he can&rsquo;t sell his head.&rdquo;
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t sell his head?&mdash;What sort of a bamboozingly
						story is this you are telling me?&rdquo; getting into a towering
						rage. &ldquo;Do you pretend to say, landlord, that this harpooneer
						is actually engaged this blessed Saturday night, or rather Sunday
						morning, in peddling his head around this town?&rdquo;
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;That&rsquo;s precisely it,&rdquo; said the landlord,
						&ldquo;and I told him he couldn&rsquo;t sell it here, the
						market&rsquo;s overstocked.&rdquo;
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>&ldquo;With what?&rdquo; shouted I.</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;With heads to be sure; ain&rsquo;t there too many heads in
						the world?&rdquo;
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;I tell you what it is, landlord,&rdquo; said I quite calmly,
						&ldquo;you&rsquo;d better stop spinning that yarn to
						me&mdash;I&rsquo;m not green.&rdquo;
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;May be not,&rdquo; taking out a stick and whittling a
						toothpick, &ldquo;but I rayther guess you&rsquo;ll be done brown if
						that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin&rsquo; his head.&rdquo;
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll break it for him,&rdquo; said I, now flying into a
						passion again at this unaccountable farrago of the landlord&rsquo;s.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s broke a&rsquo;ready,&rdquo; said he.</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;Broke,&rdquo; said I&mdash;&ldquo;broke, do you mean?&rdquo;
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;Sartain, and that&rsquo;s the very reason he can&rsquo;t sell
						it, I guess.&rdquo;
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;Landlord,&rdquo; said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla
						in a snow-storm&mdash;&ldquo;landlord, stop whittling. You and I
						must understand one another, and that too without delay. I come to
						your house and want a bed; you tell me you can only give me half a
						one; that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer. And about
						this harpooneer, whom I have not yet seen, you persist in telling me
						the most mystifying and exasperating stories tending to beget in me
						an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design for my
						bedfellow&mdash;a sort of connexion, landlord, which is an intimate
						and confidential one in the highest degree. I now demand of you to
						speak out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is, and whether I
						shall be in all respects safe to spend the night with him. And in
						the first place, you will be so good as to unsay that story about
						selling his head, which if true I take to be good evidence that this
						harpooneer is stark mad, and I&rsquo;ve no idea of sleeping with a
						madman; and you, sir, you I mean, landlord, you, sir, by trying to
						induce me to do so knowingly, would thereby render yourself liable
						to a criminal prosecution.&rdquo;
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;Wall,&rdquo; said the landlord, fetching a long breath,
						&ldquo;that&rsquo;s a purty long sarmon for a chap that rips a
						little now and then. But be easy, be easy, this here harpooneer I
						have been tellin&rsquo; you of has just arrived from the south seas,
						where he bought up a lot of &rsquo;balmed New Zealand heads (great
						curios, you know), and he&rsquo;s sold all on &rsquo;em but one, and
						that one he&rsquo;s trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow&rsquo;s
						Sunday, and it would not do to be sellin&rsquo; human heads about
						the streets when folks is goin&rsquo; to churches. He wanted to,
						last Sunday, but I stopped him just as he was goin&rsquo; out of the
						door with four heads strung on a string, for all the airth like a
						string of inions.&rdquo;
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and
						showed that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling
						me&mdash;but at the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who
						stayed out of a Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged
						in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators?
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous
						man.&rdquo;
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;He pays reg&rsquo;lar,&rdquo; was the rejoinder. &ldquo;But
						come, it&rsquo;s getting dreadful late, you had better be turning
						flukes&mdash;it&rsquo;s a nice bed; Sal and me slept in that ere bed
						the night we were spliced. There&rsquo;s plenty of room for two to
						kick about in that bed; it&rsquo;s an almighty big bed that. Why,
						afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in
						the foot of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night,
						and somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking
						his arm. Arter that, Sal said it wouldn&rsquo;t do. Come along here,
						I&rsquo;ll give ye a glim in a jiffy;&rdquo; and so saying he
						lighted a candle and held it towards me, offering to lead the way.
						But I stood irresolute; when looking at a clock in the corner, he
						exclaimed &ldquo;I vum it&rsquo;s Sunday&mdash;you won&rsquo;t see
						that harpooneer to-night; he&rsquo;s come to anchor
						somewhere&mdash;come along then; do come; won&rsquo;t ye
						come?&rdquo;
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I
						was ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure
						enough, with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four
						harpooneers to sleep abreast.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said the landlord, placing the candle on a
						crazy old sea chest that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre
						table; &ldquo;there, make yourself comfortable now, and good night
						to ye.&rdquo; I turned round from eyeing the bed, but he had
						disappeared.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of
						the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then
						glanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table,
						could see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude
						shelf, the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man
						striking a whale. Of things not properly belonging to the room,
						there was a hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one
						corner; also a large seaman&rsquo;s bag, containing the
						harpooneer&rsquo;s wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk.
						Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the
						shelf over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head
						of the bed.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to
						the light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible
						to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can
						compare it to nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges
						with little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine
						quills round an Indian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in the
						middle of this mat, as you see the same in South American ponchos.
						But could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a
						door mat, and parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort
						of guise? I put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a
						hamper, being uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little
						damp, as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a
						rainy day. I went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall,
						and I never saw such a sight in my life. I tore myself out of it in
						such a hurry that I gave myself a kink in the neck.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this
						head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time
						on the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then
						stood in the middle of the room thinking. I then took off my coat,
						and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel
						very cold now, half undressed as I was, and remembering what the
						landlord said about the harpooneer&rsquo;s not coming home at all
						that night, it being so very late, I made no more ado, but jumped
						out of my pantaloons and boots, and then blowing out the light
						tumbled into bed, and commended myself to the care of heaven.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,
						there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not
						sleep for a long time. At last I slid off into a light doze, and had
						pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I
						heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light
						come into the room from under the door.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal
						head-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a
						word till spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical
						New Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and
						without looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off
						from me on the floor in one corner, and then began working away at
						the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the
						room. I was all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted
						for some time while employed in unlacing the bag&rsquo;s mouth. This
						accomplished, however, he turned round&mdash;when, good heavens!
						what a sight! Such a face! It was of a dark, purplish, yellow
						colour, here and there stuck over with large blackish looking
						squares. Yes, it&rsquo;s just as I thought, he&rsquo;s a terrible
						bedfellow; he&rsquo;s been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here
						he is, just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn
						his face so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be
						sticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks. They
						were stains of some sort or other. At first I knew not what to make
						of this; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. I
						remembered a story of a white man&mdash;a whaleman too&mdash;who,
						falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by them. I concluded
						that this harpooneer, in the course of his distant voyages, must
						have met with a similar adventure. And what is it, thought I, after
						all! It&rsquo;s only his outside; a man can be honest in any sort of
						skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly complexion, that part
						of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely independent of the
						squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be nothing but a good
						coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot sun&rsquo;s
						tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had never
						been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these
						extraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were
						passing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me
						at all. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he
						commenced fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of
						tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on
						the old chest in the middle of the room, he then took the New
						Zealand head&mdash;a ghastly thing enough&mdash;and crammed it down
						into the bag. He now took off his hat&mdash;a new beaver
						hat&mdash;when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise. There
						was no hair on his head&mdash;none to speak of at
						least&mdash;nothing but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his
						forehead. His bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a
						mildewed skull. Had not the stranger stood between me and the door,
						I would have bolted out of it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window,
						but it was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make
						of this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my
						comprehension. Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely
						nonplussed and confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as
						much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus
						broken into my room at the dead of night. In fact, I was so afraid
						of him that I was not game enough just then to address him, and
						demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in
						him.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last
						showed his chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him
						were checkered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was
						all over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty
						Years&rsquo; War, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster
						shirt. Still more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark
						green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms. It was now
						quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped
						aboard of a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in this
						Christian country. I quaked to think of it. A peddler of heads
						too&mdash;perhaps the heads of his own brothers. He might take a
						fancy to mine&mdash;heavens! look at that tomahawk!
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about
						something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me
						that he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or
						wrapall, or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he
						fumbled in the pockets, and produced at length a curious little
						deformed image with a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a
						three days&rsquo; old Congo baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at
						first I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby
						preserved in some similar manner. But seeing that it was not at all
						limber, and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony, I
						concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed it
						proved to be. For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place,
						and removing the papered fire-board, sets up this little
						hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the andirons. The chimney
						jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty, so that I thought
						this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for
						his Congo idol.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling
						but ill at ease meantime&mdash;to see what was next to follow. First
						he takes about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket,
						and places them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship
						biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the
						shavings into a sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty
						snatches into the fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers
						(whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded
						in drawing out the biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a
						little, he made a polite offer of it to the little negro. But the
						little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he
						never moved his lips. All these strange antics were accompanied by
						still stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who seemed to be
						praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other,
						during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner.
						At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very
						unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as
						carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and
						seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business
						operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high
						time, now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell
						in which I had so long been bound.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal
						one. Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of
						it for an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth
						at the handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next
						moment the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk
						between his teeth, sprang into bed with me. I sang out, I could not
						help it now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began
						feeling me.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him
						against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he
						might be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again.
						But his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill
						comprehended my meaning.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;Who-e debel you?&rdquo;&mdash;he at last
						said&mdash;&ldquo;you no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e.&rdquo; And so
						saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;Landlord, for God&rsquo;s sake, Peter Coffin!&rdquo; shouted
						I. &ldquo;Landlord! Watch! Coffin! Angels! save me!&rdquo;
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!&rdquo;
						again growled the cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the
						tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my
						linen would get on fire. But thank heaven, at that moment the
						landlord came into the room light in hand, and leaping from the bed
						I ran up to him.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid now,&rdquo; said he, grinning again,
						&ldquo;Queequeg here wouldn&rsquo;t harm a hair of your head.&rdquo;
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;Stop your grinning,&rdquo; shouted I, &ldquo;and why
						didn&rsquo;t you tell me that that infernal harpooneer was a
						cannibal?&rdquo;
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;I thought ye know&rsquo;d it;&mdash;didn&rsquo;t I tell ye,
						he was a peddlin&rsquo; heads around town?&mdash;but turn flukes
						again and go to sleep. Queequeg, look here&mdash;you sabbee me, I
						sabbee&mdash;you this man sleepe you&mdash;you sabbee?&rdquo;
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;Me sabbee plenty&rdquo;&mdash;grunted Queequeg, puffing away
						at his pipe and sitting up in bed.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;You gettee in,&rdquo; he added, motioning to me with his
						tomahawk, and throwing the clothes to one side. He really did this
						in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way. I stood
						looking at him a moment. For all his tattooings he was on the whole
						a clean, comely looking cannibal. What&rsquo;s all this fuss I have
						been making about, thought I to myself&mdash;the man&rsquo;s a human
						being just as I am: he has just as much reason to fear me, as I have
						to be afraid of him. Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a
						drunken Christian.
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;Landlord,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;tell him to stash his
						tomahawk there, or pipe, or whatever you call it; tell him to stop
						smoking, in short, and I will turn in with him. But I don&rsquo;t
						fancy having a man smoking in bed with me. It&rsquo;s dangerous.
						Besides, I ain&rsquo;t insured.&rdquo;
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely
						motioned me to get into bed&mdash;rolling over to one side as much
						as to say&mdash;&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t touch a leg of ye.&rdquo;
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;Good night, landlord,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you may
						go.&rdquo;
					</p>
					<p><br /></p>
					<p>I turned in, and never slept better in my life.</p>
					<p><br /></p>
